This package was forked as "linux-modules-sidux-main-2.6" to build 
external modules for sidux' kernel packages in february 2008 by Stefan 
Lippers-Hollmann <s.l-h@gmx.de> and is intended to closely track packaging 
changes made in debian's (upstream) "linux-modules-extra-2.6".
Decisions on the packaging and shipped module packages are made by the 
sidux project.
