 .
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

Description: Driver for compression filesystem modules for Linux 2.6.24 on PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/P4
 This package provides the Driver for compression filesystem modules for
 the Linux kernel version 2.6.24 on Pentium Pro/Celeron/Pentium II/Pentium

 .
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

Description: Driver for compression filesystem modules for Linux 2.6.24 on multiprocessor 64-bit UltraSPARC
 This package provides the Driver for compression filesystem modules for
 the Linux kernel version 2.6.24 on multiprocessor 64-bit UltraSPARC
 machines.
 .
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

Description: Driver for a stackable unification filesystem modules for Linux 2.6.24 on multiprocessor 64-bit UltraSPARC
 This package provides the Driver for a stackable unification filesystem
 modules for the Linux kernel version 2.6.24 on multiprocessor 64-bit
 UltraSPARC machines.
 .
 The unionfs driver provides a unification filesystem.  It allows to
 virtually merge the contents of several directories and/or stack them, so
 that apparent file changes in the unionfs end in file changes in only one
 of the source directories.
