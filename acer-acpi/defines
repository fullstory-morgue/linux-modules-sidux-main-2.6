 acer_acpi is a driver to allow you to control various aspects of your Acer
 laptop hardware using the proc filesystem.  It was originally developed in
 order to activate the wireless LAN card under a 64-bit version of Linux,
 as acerhk (the previous fine solution to the problem) relied on making BIOS
 calls which are not allowed from a 64-bit OS.
